<h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
<p><b>I believe in upholding high standards with an absolute commitment to strive to understand and improve the educational process, using team strategies, while wholly centering on student achievement.

In a fast changing world,the school strives to respect the unique individuality of each child, give the child the right kind of help. We believe that a child<br> will be successful in life if we accept him/her as they are and inspire them to become what they want to become. 

We give lot of importance to make discipline a core value, encourage students to develop a sense of responsibility through a well planned academic schedule,<br> House system, various Inter School, Intra School competitions and Sports activities. We are serving here true to our potential to transform the young ones into a  future citizen with fully developed competencies and 21st century skills.

In our school, there is a strong ethos of parental involvement as It is only when teachers, students, parents and other members of the community work in partnership<br> that a child can grow into an adult who displays sensitivity, integrity, good citizenship <br>and respect for human diversity. Keeping this in mind, we use various modes like the school Almanac, the monthly planners, the daily work flow, parent portal on the school website and SMS at various intervals so that our worthy parents can get all the relevant information about the school like the routine, rules and regulation, uniforms, test schedules, holidays, co- curricular activities etc.     

We believe that education is not about mere imparting knowledge but more about opening the child’s mind to self- expression and our dedicated team of teachers,<br> administrative staff, aware and cooperative parents, and a management imbued with great vision, form a unified team to give  your child the required edge to make his/her mark in this global world. It is our aim to help all students achieve<br> a level of excellence in their chosen field. Together we , parents and school, will have to move along to transform the young ones into a potential source of knowledge, energy, strength, and a catalytic force to  metamorphose the social fabric to complement our school motto, ‘Arise, Awake And Stop Not Till The Goal Is Achieved’.</p>
